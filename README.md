DragonAPI
=========

The library that RotaryCraft and my other Minecraft mods use, to centralize and simplify functions.
This library relies on MinecraftForge!


Update from fiddler500:

This version of DragonAPI has been stripped of all DRM and anti-mod code, and is now released under full GPL license! Modpacks can do what you want!
